# Classroom Demonstrations â€” Frontend JavaScript Only

## Purpose

This repository is for student classroom demonstrations using **frontend JavaScript** only.  
Projects in this repository are designed to be simple, readable, and beginner-friendly.

## Language and Technology Constraints

- **Languages**: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- **NO frameworks or libraries** allowed, including:
  - React
  - jQuery
  - Vue.js
  - Angular
  - Any external JavaScript libraries

## Code Style Guidelines

When writing or suggesting code for this repository:

- **Always** use `if/else` logic.  
  - **Avoid** ternary (`condition ? true : false`) expressions.
- **Always** declare variables with `let` unless `const` is clearly required.  
  - **Avoid** using `var`.
- **Use old-style string concatenation** with `+` operator.  
  - **Avoid** using template literals (backticks `` ` ``).
    - Example: `"Hello, " + name + "!"` instead of `` `Hello, ${name}!` ``

## File Organization

- Each project or demo should have its own folder.
- Each project folder should include:
  - An `index.html`
  - A `main.css` (even if minimal)
  - A `main.js`

## Additional Notes

- Code should prioritize **clarity** and **readability** over efficiency or conciseness.
- Comments are encouraged, especially to explain steps in JavaScript files.
- Each function should have a **short comment** explaining its purpose.
- **When writing callbacks**, prefer using **arrow functions** instead of anonymous `function()` syntax.
- **Avoid** using `switch` statements. Use `if/else` logic consistently.
- Assume `main.css` and `main.js` at all times when writing HTML.
